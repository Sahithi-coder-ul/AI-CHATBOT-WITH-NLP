##DESCRIPTION:

For this task, I built a simple AI chatbot capable of understanding and responding to user queries using Natural Language Processing (NLP). I utilized NLTK and spaCy libraries for language processing, including tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition. The chatbot was trained on a small dataset of predefined responses and integrated with a basic conversational interface using Python.

This task deepened my understanding of how NLP works in real-time applications and gave me practical experience in handling text data, performing intent recognition, and improving response generation. It was a rewarding experience that enhanced my problem-solving and Python scripting skills in the domain of AI.
